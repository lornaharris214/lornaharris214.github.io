"My Awesome Homepage"

Working on this has been a wonderful experience, especially delving into media queries and such in my spare time. This website was done from the ground up. I created the HTML for index.html and then messed around with the css of styles.css in my own time until I liked it enough. And then I started building from there, playing around with media queries, and getting to better understand CSS as a whole. When I finally produced something that I liked, I changed my entire website on Github to the one I had done on my spare time. I hope you enjoy it!
