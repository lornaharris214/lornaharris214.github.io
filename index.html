        <h2>"What is Happiness?"</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Lorna Harris and I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University. I'm studying Visual Communication Design and Communication Studies. My primary major, VCD, has been a passion I have pursued since I was roughly 14. My inspiration came from a job fair that happened early in my Freshmen year of high school. I was already pretty obsessed with art and was learning digital art in my free time. Luckily, graphic design courses were offered at my high school so I was able to harness my skills before college.</p>
        <p>Aside from Art and Design, I love many things. I have had the amazing opportunity of being the EWU Gamers Club president since 2013. I feel like leading this group and helping them rise from the ashes has been a great learning experience, especially when it comes to the Communication Studies world. I have developed leadership, treasury, and time management skills in this process and am extremely grateful for their patience and understanding. We have grown so large and have influenced many around campus.</p>

        <h3>Commissions</h3>
        <p>I will gladly take most commissions requested of me. For now, my prices depend solely on the money needed for supplies and how much time will be spent on the project. I do all sorts of projects from gaming playmats to designs or paintings. Head on over to the about page to get my email!</p>
